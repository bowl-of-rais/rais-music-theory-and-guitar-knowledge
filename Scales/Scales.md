## Scales as a sequence of steps

One way of thinking about scales is to see them as a sequence of notes with a certain distance in between - mostly whole and half steps. The specific scale is then defined by the root note, i.e. the note on which we start our sequence, and the type of scale, i.e. what the sequence of steps look like.

For instance, the step sequence of any major scale looks like this:
$$
	1 - 1 - \frac{1}{2} - 1 - 1 - 1 - \frac{1}{2}
$$
So, if we want to figure out the notes of the G major scale, we just have to start at G and find the following notes according to the sequence. We move a whole step up from the G to A, then another whole step up to B, then a half step up to C, and so on. The result looks like this:

```vextab
tabstave notation=true tablature=false
notes G-A-B/4 C/5 | D-E-F#-G/5
```
