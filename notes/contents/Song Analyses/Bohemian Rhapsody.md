## David Bennett: [A Brief Analysis of Bohemian Rhapsody](TODO)

### Structure
-> through-composed: no repeating parts, irregular form

five sections:
1. a capella/intro
2. ballad: has verses but each is slightly different
3. operatic
4. rock
5. coda/outro

### 1. Intro: A capella

beginning chord:
```vextab
tabstave notation=true tablature=false key=Bb
notes :8 ## (D/4.F/4.G/4.B/4) (D/4.F/4.G/4.B/4) (D/4.F/4.G/4.B/4) :4 (D/4.F/4.G/4.B/4) (D/4.F/4.G/4.B/4) $Is,this,the,real,life$
```
can be interpreted as either Gm7 (G - Bb - D + F) or Bb6 (Bb - D - F + G)
-> depends on context: more major or minor feel?

second line:
```vextab
tabstave notation=true tablature=false key=Bb
notes :8 ## (C/4.En/4.G/4.B/4) (C/4.E/4.G/4.B/4) (D/4.F/4.G/4.B/4) (C/4.E/4.G/4.B/4) :16 (B/3.D/4.F/4.G/4) (B/3.C/4.E/4.G/4) $Is,this,just,fan-,ta-,sy$
```
- E is raised to a natural
- chord in key of Bb would be a Cm but now it's a C(7)
- C7 is dominant chord of F, which is again the dominant chord of Bb, aka: C7 is a **secondary dominant**

[TODO following notes]
- C7 is followed by F7 ("V-I"), and then we move from there to Bb (V-I again)

beginning pattern:
- many perfect cadences + secondary dominants
- contrasted by chromatic stuff (later)

open your eyes:
Gm - Bb7 - Eb
- Bb7 - Eb is another V-I
- illusion: key change to Eb, but chords still fit with key of Bb

I need no sympathy:
F7:
- has A natural, therefore might belong to Bb
- is also secondary dominant in Eb tho
- ALMOST resolves to Bb, which is "trapped" in chromatic movements

*Bohemian motif*: builds tension by meandering around desired resolution chromatically

*Line Cliche*: chord progression moving downwards in half-steps

which is exactly what's happening here:
```vextab
tabstave notation=true tablature=false key=Bb
notes :h (E/4.G/4.B/4) (D/4.F/4.B/4) (D@/4.F@/4.B/4) (C/4.F/4.A/4)
```

then: emphasis on F (extra bar in different voicing) which resolves to Bb in V-I motion
