## What is an Interval?

> Interval: A specified distance betwene two pitches. Intervals define every possible relationship between pitches
> *- Fretboard Mastery (Troy Stetina)*

each interval has
- a unique name
- a unique sound
- a unique shape on the guitar fretboard

## Interval Names

The interval names are based on the steps in a scale. For instance, the note that is a 4th above a C will be the 4th note in the C major scale.

There are two kinds of intervals: **perfect** and **imperfect** intervals. There is only one version of each perfect interval, whereas imperfect intervals have two versions (major and minor).

Here is a table showing each interval with its name and the distance in semitones it represents:

| Distance | Name      | Example | Song |
| -------- | --------- | ------- | ---- |
| 0        | Unison    | C-C     |      |
| 1        | Minor 2nd | C-C#    |      |
| 2        | Major 2nd | C-D     |      |
| 3        | Minor 3rd | C-D#    |      |
| 4        | Major 3rd | C-E     |      |
| 5        | 4th       | C-F     |      |
| 6        | Tritone   | C-F#    |      |
| 7        | 5th       | C-G     |      |
| 8        | Minor 6th | C-G#    |      |
| 9        | Major 6th | C-A     |      |
| 10       | Minor 7th | C-Bb    |      |
| 11       | Major 7th | C-B     |      |
| 12       | Octave    | C-C     |      |


## Interval Sounds

We can differentiate between melodic and harmonic intervals:

> When the notes follow another, as in a melody, we say it is a **melodic interval**. When the notes sound simultaneously, as in a chord, we say it is a **harmonic interval**.

Harmonic intervals can be either **consonant** (i.e. the sound blends together well) or **dissonant** (i.e. the two notes 'clash')
